## Abstract (short)

As EV aggregators increasingly participate in ancillary services markets, they must balance reliability requirements with financial exposure to penalties for reserve shortfalls. We propose a **penalty-aware bidding model** that integrates expected penalty costs directly into the bidding objective, using a generalizable formulation centered on the **penalty growth rate**. The approach is benchmarked against two baselines (an EVT-based reliability method and a sample-based MILP) on real-world EV fleet data, showing improved **net revenue** while maintaining near-optimal reliability under realistic penalty regimes.
